Blackjack

From a standard fifty-two card deck of playing cards, both the player
and the dealer are given two cards. The player aims to reach but not 
exceed twenty-one points in his/her hand with numerical cards holding the
point value of the number printed on them, face cards being worth 10 points
and aces being worth 1 or 11 points (at the discretion of the player who
holds the ace.

Both the dealer and the house are dealt a two cards initally: one face up
and the other face down. The player may look at their card and choose to 
draw as many times as they please. They player loses if the point value 
of their hand exceeds 21. If the player decides at any point not to draw,
the dealer will begin his/her turn. 

If the dealer's hand is worth less than 17 points, the dealer will
continue to draw until they have at least 17 points. If the dealer's hand
exceeds 21 points at any time, the player automatically wins.
